        name: Fighter
        description: |
        The fighter is the typical single manned light attack ship. Low cost,
        low resilience, low damage, high manueverability. Also cannot navigate 
        deep space by themselves (require escort)
    -
        name: Dreadnought
        description: |
        Dreadnoughts are the strongest armoured, most heavily armmed ships in a 
        fleet. They pack huge amounts of missiles, and are near impossible to destroy
    -
        name: Battlecruiser
        description: |
        This is the generalist ship of the fleet. It has medium armor with a reasonable
        amount of firepower
    -
        name: Destroyer
        description: |
        This is a fleets ultimate weapons platform. It not very manueverabile or 
        resilient, but it has more firepower than any other ship.
    -
        name: Light Cruiser
        description: |
        This is a step up from a fighter, but not heavily armored or outfitted well 
        enough to be a battle cruiser.

        name: Aircraft Carrier
        description: |
        This is a docking station for fighters. It has average armor, average 
        guns, and allows for more fighters to be played. Also are cheap.
    -
        name: Assault Ship
        description: |
        This ship has a very high attack value, but must be adjacent to do it. It
        drops marines onto the other ship, which may have other effects
    -
        name: Explorer
        description: |
        Very fast small ship with little to no guns. It will either provide information
        (not sure what or how) or maybe allow for other ships to have better shots?
