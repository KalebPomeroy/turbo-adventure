    decorates RequestHandlers and builds up a list of routables handlers

    Tech Notes (or 'What the *@# is really happening here?')
    --------------------------------------------------------

    Everytime @route('...') is called, we instantiate a new route object which
    saves off the passed in URI. Then, since it's a decorator, the function is
    passed to the route.__call__ method as an argument. We save a reference to
    that handler with our uri in our class level routes list then return that
    class to be instantiated as normal.

    Later, we can call the classmethod route.get_routes to return that list of
    tuples which can be handed directly to the tornado.web.Application
    instantiation.

    Example
    -------

    @route('/some/path')
    class SomeRequestHandler(RequestHandler):
        pass

    @route('/some/path', name='other')
    class SomeOtherRequestHandler(RequestHandler):
        pass

    my_routes = route.get_routes()
